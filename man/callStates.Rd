}
\arguments{
\item{P}{Posterior probabilities, as generated by GMMreshape()}

\item{cid}{Column containing cell IDs}

\item{tm}{(optional) vector mapping marker -> cell type}

\item{pthr}{probability threshold above which a cell is considered to express the marker}
}
\value{
The original frame P augmented with cell state and achor marker information
